## ERRANT Demo

Assuming you have read the main readme and downloaded all the dependencies etc., you can try running ERRANT on the sample text in this folder to make sure it's running properly.

Specifically, from this demo directory run:

`errant parallel_to_m2 -orig orig.txt -cor cor1.txt cor2.txt -out test.m2`

This should produce a file called `test.m2` which is identical to `out.m2`.
