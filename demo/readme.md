## ERRANT Demo

Assuming you have read the main readme and installed ERRANT successfully, you can try running it on the sample text in this directory to make sure it's running properly:

`errant_parallel -orig orig.txt -cor cor1.txt cor2.txt -out test.m2`

This should produce a file called `test.m2` which is identical to `out.m2`.
